    "In machine learning, k Nearest Neighbours or kNN is the simplest of all machine learning algorithms. It is a non-parametric algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. Non-parametric means there is no assumption required for data distribution. So, kNN does not require any underlying assumption to be made. In both classification and regression tasks, the input consists of the k closest training examples in the feature space. The output depends upon whether kNN is used for classification or regression purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "In kNN classification, the output is a class membership. The given data point is classified based on the majority of type of its neighbours. The data point is assigned to the most frequent class among its k nearest neighbours. Usually k is a small positive integer. If k=1, then the data point is simply assigned to the class of that single nearest neighbour.\n",
    "\n",
    "In kNN regression, the output is simply some property value for the object. This value is the average of the values of k nearest neighbours.\n",
    "\n",
    "kNN is a type of instance-based learning or lazy learning. Lazy learning means it does not require any training data points for model generation. All training data will be used in the testing phase. This makes training faster and testing slower and costlier. So, the testing phase requires more time and memory resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "In kNN, the neighbours are taken from a set of objects for which the class or the object property value is known. This can be thought of as the training set for the kNN algorithm, though no explicit training step is required. In both classification and regression kNN algorithm, we can assign weight to the contributions of the neighbours. So, nearest neighbours contribute more to the average than the more distant ones."

    "The kNN algorithm intuition is very simple to understand. It simply calculates the distance between a sample data point and all the other training data points.

Finally, it assigns the sample data point to the class to which the majority of the k data points belong.\n",

    "While building the kNN classifier model, one question that come to my mind is what should be the value of nearest neighbours (k) that yields highest accuracy. This is a very important question because the classification accuracy depends upon our choice of k.\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of neighbours (k) in kNN is a parameter that we need to select at the time of model building. Selecting the optimal value of k in kNN is the most critical problem. A small value of k means that noise will have higher influence on the result. So, probability of overfitting is very high. A large value of k makes it computationally expensive in terms of time to build the kNN model. Also, a large value of k will have a smoother decision boundary which means lower variance but higher bias.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data scientists choose an odd value of k if the number of classes is even. We can apply the elbow method to select the value of k. To optimize the results, we can use Cross Validation technique. Using the cross-validation technique, we can test the kNN algorithm with different values of k. The model which gives good accuracy can be considered to be an optimal choice. It depends on individual cases and at times best process is to run through each possible value of k and test our result."

    "In k-fold cross-validation, the original sample is randomly partitioned into k equal size subsamples. Of the k subsamples, a single subsample is retained as the validation data for testing the model, and the remaining k-1 subsamples are used as training data. The cross-validation process is then repeated k times (the folds), with each of the k subsamples used exactly once as the validation data. The k results from the folds can then be averaged (or otherwise combined) to produce a single estimation. The advantage of this method is that all observations are used for both training and validation, and each observation is used for validation exactly once."
